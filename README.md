Campground Weather App

This web application helps you plan your next camping trip by providing the current weather conditions at your chosen campground. Simply enter the campground name and the state where it's located, and the app will use the power of two APIs:

Google Maps API: This API helps pinpoint the exact location of the campground based on your search. Behind the scenes, the app uses the campground name and state to make a request to Google Maps. This helps ensure the weather data retrieved is accurate for the specific campground you have in mind.
Weather API: Once the location is confirmed, the app utilizes a weather API to fetch real-time weather information for that area. This includes details like temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.
The app then displays the retrieved weather data, giving you a clear picture of the current conditions at the campground. This information can be crucial for choosing the right gear and packing for your camping adventure!
